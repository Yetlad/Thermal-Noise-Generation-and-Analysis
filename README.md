# Thermal Noise Simulation Using MATLAB

##  Objective
The objective of this experiment is to simulate and analyze **thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) noise** 
using MATLAB and visualize its characteristics in both the **time domain** and **frequency domain**.

This experiment provides hands-on understanding of thermal noise generation and allows exploration of how different physical parameters affect noise behavior.

##  Theory
Thermal noise is generated by the random motion of electrons in a resistor and is given by:

Vₙ = √(4kTRB)

Where:
- k = Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)
- T = Temperature (Kelvin)
- R = Resistance (Ohms)
- B = Bandwidth (Hz)

Thermal noise has a **flat (white) power spectral density** over frequency.

##  Experiment Parameters
| Parameter | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Bandwidth (B) | 1 MHz |
| Resistance (R) | 100 Ω |
| Temperature (T) | 300 K |
| Samples | 10,000 |

##  MATLAB Implementation
The simulation:
1. Generates thermal noise using a Gaussian random process.
2. Plots the noise in the **time domain**.
3. Computes and plots the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** using Welch’s method.
4. Compares theoretical and simulated RMS noise voltage.

##  Results

### Time-Domain Observation
- The noise amplitude fluctuates randomly around zero.
- Higher resistance, temperature, or bandwidth increases noise amplitude.

### Frequency-Domain Observation (PSD)
- The PSD is approximately flat across frequency.
- Confirms thermal noise behaves as **white noise**.
